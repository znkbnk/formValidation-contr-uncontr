In this project you will build a
form validation application using
React that demonstrates the concepts of
controlled and uncontrolled components.

Step 1: Set up the project:

- Create a new React project using your
preferred method (e.g., Create React App).
- Set up the necessary file structure and
install any required dependencies.

Step 2: Create the Form component:

- Create a new component called "Form"
that represents the main form.
- Inside the Form component, create a
form element with appropriate
attributes and event handlers.

Step 3: Implement controlled components:

- Add state variables to the
Form component to track the form
input values.
- Bind the input elements to their
respective state variables using
the value prop.
- Add onChange event handlers to update
the state variables when the input
values change.

Step 4: Add validation logic:

- Define the validation rules for
each form field (e.g., required,
minimum length, etc.).
- Create validation functions to
check if the input values meet
the defined rules.
- Update the state variables to store
the validation status for each input field.

Step 5: Display validation errors:

- Create a component or section to 
display validation errors.
- Use conditional rendering to show the
validation errors only when the
corresponding input fields have
invalid values.

Step 6: Implement uncontrolled components:

- Refactor the Form component to use
uncontrolled components for one or
more input fields.
- Remove the state variables and event
handlers associated with the
uncontrolled components.
- Use ref objects to access the input
field values when needed.

Step 7: Test the form:

- Render the Form component in your
main application file.
- Fill in the form with various inputs
to test the validation logic.
- Verify that the validation errors are
displayed correctly for both
controlled and uncontrolled components.

Step 8: Add form submission:

Implement a submit button within the form.
- Add an onSubmit event handler to 
the form element.
- Perform any necessary actions when
the form is submitted (e.g., sending data
to a server, displaying a success message,
etc.).

Step 9: Style the form:

- Apply CSS styles to the form and its
elements to make it visually appealing.
- Use CSS frameworks or custom styles
based on your preference.
